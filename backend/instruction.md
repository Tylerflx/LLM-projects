# Step-by-Step Tutorial: Building a Context-Aware AI Application

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

### Setup Python Backend:
- Install Python and create a virtual environment for your project.
  
### Initialize React.js Frontend:
- Install Node.js and create a new React.js project.

## Step 2: Backend Development

### Load PDF Files:
- Use Python's `os` module to load PDF files from a designated folder.

### Split Text:
- Utilize a PDF processing library to extract text from PDFs and split them into smaller chunks.

### Convert to Embeddings:
- Implement text-to-embedding conversion using NLP libraries like `transformers` or `sentence-transformers`. Store embeddings in a database.

### Build Retrieval Chain:
- Construct a retrieval chain using tools like LangChain, integrating methods such as TF-IDF or BM25.

### Expose APIs:
- Create APIs using Flask or FastAPI to provide access to the retrieval chain and stored embeddings.

## Step 3: Frontend Development

### Create React Components:
- Develop React components for user interface elements such as input boxes, buttons, and result displays.

### Fetch API Data:
- Use `fetch` or `axios` to make requests to your Python backend APIs.

### Display Results:
- Update React component state with retrieved responses and display them to the user.

## Step 4: Integration of Tools
### Integrate LangChain:
- Utilize LangChain's capabilities within your Flask/FastAPI application for implementing the retrieval chain.

### Chroma DB and Ollama Integration:
- Depending on specific functionalities, integrate Chroma DB and Ollama into your backend processing.

## Step 5: Testing and Deployment

### Testing:
- Thoroughly test your application to ensure all functionalities work as expected.

### Deployment:
- Deploy your Python backend (Flask/FastAPI) on a server (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
- Deploy your React.js frontend on a static file server (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

## Additional Considerations

- **Security:** Implement security measures like HTTPS, input validation, and authentication.
  
- **Performance:** Optimize both backend and frontend code for performance, especially for handling large datasets and multiple users.
  
- **Scalability:** Design your application architecture to be scalable, considering potential future enhancements and increased user load.
