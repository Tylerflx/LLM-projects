# LLM-projects
This repository serves as a learning platform for exploring LangChain, Chroma DB, and Ollama in the context of building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application. Utilizing FastAPI for deployment, the projects here aim to demonstrate proficiency in these tools for enhanced natural language processing and data management capabilities.
